# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for Image Synthesis with PyTorch

## Overview

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for image synthesis using PyTorch. The goal is to generate realistic images that resemble a given dataset.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Placeholder for the dataset.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for exploration and analysis.
  - `Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`: Notebook for data preprocessing and exploration.
  - `GAN_Model_Training.ipynb`: Notebook containing the GAN model training process.
  - `Image_Synthesis_Inference.ipynb`: Notebook for generating synthetic images.

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the GAN model.
  - `gan_model.py`: Python script defining the PyTorch GAN model.
  - `train.py`: Python script for training the GAN model.
  - `generate.py`: Python script for generating synthetic images.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- Matplotlib
